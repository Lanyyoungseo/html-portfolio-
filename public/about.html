<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Lany was born in 2002 and she is from Korea. of course our contry's president IS NOT Kim Jong Un. 
 I moved to Australia in 2022. I was such a baby and so innocent. Evan, my current boyfriend, found me and fell in love at first sight.
 To be honest, I thought Evan was Korean cos he looks so Korean and didn't think much about him on the first day at Orientation cos it was so hectic
 and there were so many people. I actually thought he is so bubbly and has a cute smile haha.
 Anyways we got together and became best friends and a perfect couple. I love him. so much. to an extent you could never imagine
