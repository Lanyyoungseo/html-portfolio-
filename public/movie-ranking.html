<h1>The Best Movies According to Lany</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
 <h3>Intern</h3>
  <p>
      This is my favourite movie. I love how the old man opens a new chanper and keeps trying.
  </p>
  <h3>Notebook</h3>
  <p>
      This is a romantic genre. The main characters fell in love with each other when there were kids and they reunite when they grew up.
  </p>
  <h3>Crazy Rich Asians</h3>
  <p>
      This is really funny. I think it's about how rich Singaporean family lives.
